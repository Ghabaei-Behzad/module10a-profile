# Module 10A – Profile Component with State and Props
This particular README.md file was interesting because it was created and pushed through with git.
There is a README.md file available in the root and .gitignore files were made to prevent node_modules from getting pushed to github. 
I learned to create a details property in order to make the pop-up from our button distinct.  I also learned that a group of flashcards could be created this way by placing the questions on top and answers inside the "show details" paragraph. Here is some code snippets that will imitate flashcards.
 <h1> CS 81 - Flashcards </h1>
        <FlashCards
        number="#1"
        subject="module 10"
        question="dynamic rendering in React refers to..."
        answer="generating components from array of data using methods like .map()"
        />
          <FlashCards
        number="#2"
        subject="module 10"
        question="what makes React components reusable?"
        answer="using props to accept different data and customize behavior."
        />
        const FlashCards = ({ number, subject, question, answer }) 
  ## What I Learned
- How to pass props to customize a component
- How to use useState for conditional rendering
- How to design interactive interfaces in React
- Learned .jsx syntax
- Using git commands
- Learning to push README to github
- researching how to putting user_modules inside of gitignore to prevent from pushing these to github with git.
- practicing button event handling and function syntax for buttons.
- new css style options that I have not used before.
