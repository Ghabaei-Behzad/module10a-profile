# Module 10A – Profile Component with State and Props
This particular README.md file was interesting because it was created and pushed through with git.
There is a README.md file available in the root and .gitignore files were made to prevent node_modules from getting pushed to github. 

## What I Learned
- How to pass props to customize a component
- How to use useState for conditional rendering
- How to design interactive interfaces in React
- Learned .jsx syntax
- Using git commands
- Learning to push README to github
